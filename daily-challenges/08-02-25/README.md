1. **Problem 1: Maximum Product Subarray**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

   The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

   Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
   Output: 6
   Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

2. **Problem 2: Product of Array Except Self**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ```
   Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

   The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

   You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

   Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
   Output: [24,12,8,6]

3. **Problem 3: Subarray Sum Equals K**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

   A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

   Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
   Output: 2

1. **Problem 1: Climbing Stairs**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

   Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

   Input: n = 3
   Output: 3
   Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
   1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
   2. 1 step + 2 steps
   3. 2 steps + 1 step

   Constraints: 
   1 <= n <= 45

2. **Problem 2: Coin Change**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ```
   You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

   Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

   You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

   Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
   Output: 3
   Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

   Constraints:
   1 <= coins.length <= 12
   1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
   0 <= amount <= 104

   ```

3. **Problem 3: House Robber**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

   Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

   Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
   Output: 4
   Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
   Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

   Constraints:
   1 <= nums.length <= 100
   0 <= nums[i] <= 400

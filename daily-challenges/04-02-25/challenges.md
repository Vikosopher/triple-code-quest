1. **Problem 1: Contains Duplicate**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

   Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

   Output: true
 
   Explanation:

   The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

   Constraints: 
   1 <= nums.length <= 105
   -10 ^ 9 <= nums[i] <= 10 ^ 9

2. **Problem 2: Maximum Subarray**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ```
   Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

   Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
   Output: 6
   Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

   Constraints:
   1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
   -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

   ```

3. **Problem 3: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

   [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
   [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
   Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

   Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

   You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

   Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
   Output: 1
   Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

   Constraints:
   n == nums.length
   1 <= n <= 5000
   -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
   All the integers of nums are unique.
   nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

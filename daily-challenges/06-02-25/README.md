1. **Problem 1: Binary Search**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

   You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

   Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
   Output: 4
   Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

2. **Problem 2: Search Insert Position**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ```
   Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

   You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

   Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
   Output: 2

3. **Problem 3: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

   If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

   You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

   Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
   Output: [3,4]

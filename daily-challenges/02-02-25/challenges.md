1. **Problem 1: Subsets II**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible 
   subsets(the power set).

   The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

   Input: nums = [1,2,2]
   Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]

   Constraints: 
   1 <= nums.length <= 10
   -10 <= nums[i] <= 10

2. **Problem 2: Combination Sum**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ```
   Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

   The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

   The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

   Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
   Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

   Constraints:
   1 <= candidates.length <= 30
   2 <= candidates[i] <= 40
   All elements of candidates are distinct.
   1 <= target <= 40

3. **Problem 3: Permutation Sequence**
   - **Problem Statement:** 
   
   ````
   The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

   By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

   "123" "132" "213" "231" "312" "321" ->
   Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

   Input: n = 3, k = 3
   Output: "213"

   Constraints:
   1 <= n <= 9
   1 <= k <= n!
